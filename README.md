# Python Automation Scripts

Welcome to the Python Automation Scripts repository! This project is a curated collection of Python scripts designed to automate a variety of simple tasks, streamlining your workflow and enhancing productivity. Each script in this repository aims to solve a specific problem or automate a routine task, from manipulating Excel files to processing text data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into branches, each representing a different script or automation task. This structure allows for easy navigation and isolation of each script, ensuring that users can find and use the tools they need efficiently.

### Branches

- `main`: The default branch containing the project overview and general information.
- `feature/nodal-delay-calculator`: A branch for the Total Nodal Delay Calculator script, a GUI application to calculate the total nodal delay in a network based on user inputs.
- `Excel_row_parser`: A branch for the Row Parser script, which processes an Excel file by selecting every 22nd row and saves the result to a CSV file.
- Other branches: Each branch is named according to the script or task it automates, providing a focused environment for that specific automation.

## Scripts Overview

Below is a list of currently available scripts, each residing in its own branch:

- `row_parser.py`: A script for reducing the resolution of time series data in Excel files.
- `nodal_delay_calculator.py`: A script for calculating the total nodal delay in a network using a GUI interface.
- *More scripts will be added over time.*

## Getting Started

To use the scripts in this repository:

1. Clone the repository or the specific branch containing the script you need.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The scripts have been tested with Python 3.8 and above.
3. Install any dependencies required by the script, typically listed at the top of the script file or in a `requirements.txt` file in the branch.
4. Run the script following the instructions provided in the script's comments or the branch's `README.md`.
